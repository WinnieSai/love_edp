        The PAWS Fetch & Fix Program aims to end the cycle of homelessness for the pets of people with limited means. For many, spaying and neutering helps prevent their situation from worsening. It allows them to care for their pets without worrying about accidental litters by nominating someone you see who needs this support.

    <div class="description description-2">
        With their consent, PAWS will fetch the pets, bring them to the shelter clinic for surgery, and return them after recovery. All costs — transport and surgery — are covered through donations.
